## What is Dreamweaver?  

**Dreamweaver** is a professional **web design and development environment** created to help developers and designers build modern, responsive websites and web applications with precision. Known for its visual editing tools and powerful code capabilities, Dreamweaver bridges the gap between creativity and clean, production-ready code.  

Originally developed by **Macromedia** and later acquired by **Adobe**, Dreamweaver has become one of the most versatile platforms for front-end developers. It supports HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, and multiple frameworks, providing a live preview environment that updates as you code.  

Users can design layouts visually using an intuitive drag-and-drop editor or dive deep into the source code with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and Git integration. Dreamweaver also connects easily to FTP servers, allowing you to upload and synchronize projects directly from the app.  

Ideal for both beginners and advanced developers, Dreamweaver enables responsive web design with real-time device previews, helping ensure consistent performance across desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Its extensive template library and framework compatibility make it a one-stop solution for web design, from concept to deployment.
